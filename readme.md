# wp-bones-scss
A starter Wordpress theme based on the awesome Bones, but with my own preferred SCSS structure.

I use this to kick off any personal and client WP projects, but anyone is welcome to it.

* Compass
* npm 
* my own SCSS library

Requires ACF plugin (free version is ok):

There's no Gulp, Grunt, Bower, Browserify, Webpack, or WTF -- on purpose. I left them out in case the new project requires one or the other.

## Bones
Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
